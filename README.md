# PHMS_Project
This project is known as Patient Health Monitoring System (PHMS). It is built on the LAMP stack and uses Python 2.7.13 as the backend 
for the hardware functionality and traditional LAMP stack implementation 
on the software end. MySQL database is used for long term data storage and retrieval.

Raspberry Pi 3 is used as the hardware backend
and different sensors like Blood Pressure sensor, Temperature sensor and Pulse rate sensor are interfaced to the Raspberry Pi 3.
The hardware module and the actual web application is built. LAMP stack stands for Linux OS, Apache Web Server
MySQL database and PHP scripting language.

The web application which is hosted on an online server is then connected to the hardware module via HTTP. 
The actual task of Patient Health Monitoring System then takes place with the sensors data getting displayed on the 
remotely present doctor's device. The data exchange session between the PHMS hardware kit and the remote server takes place
until the patient is connected to the portal.
The health data gets stored in the MySQL database for long term usage and reference both by the 
patients and the doctor.

The patients can even see their medical prescriptions prescribed by their doctors, download their past health monitoring records,
Book Appointments for health monitoring with the concerned doctor. The doctors and patients can even chat by using an online chat
application integrated into PHMS portal. The patients and doctors can even take part in Video Conferencing. The patients and doctors can
even lodge complaints and queries related to the PHMS portal in general which will be resolved by an administrator at it's earliest. 
The complaints lodged are resolved through the mail delivery.
